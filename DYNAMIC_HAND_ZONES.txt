# DYNAMIC HAND ZONES SYSTEM

## Overview
A gesture recognition system where each hand has its own **dynamic zone** that follows the hand's position. Instead of fixed zones on the sides, each hand creates a 200x200 pixel square zone around itself that moves as the hand moves.

## Comparison with Fixed Zones

### Fixed Zones (two-handed-buffer.html)
```
[LEFT ZONE]              [RIGHT ZONE]
┌─────────┐              ┌─────────┐
│ Fixed   │              │ Fixed   │
│ 0-25%   │   Content    │ 75-100% │
│         │              │         │
└─────────┘              └─────────┘
```

### Dynamic Zones (this system)
```
    ┌─────────┐
    │ Follows │ ← Moves with left hand
    │  Hand   │
    └─────────┘
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │ Follows │ ← Moves with right hand
                    │  Hand   │
                    └─────────┘
```

## Key Innovation: Following Zones
- Each hand generates its own zone that tracks with hand movement
- Zones appear when hands are detected and disappear when hands leave
- Gestures must start within the hand's own zone to be recognized
- Prevents accidental gestures from random hand movements

## How It Works

### Dynamic Zone Behavior
```
┌─────────┐
│  Zone   │ ← Follows left hand
│ (Blue)  │   200x200px square
└─────────┘

          ┌─────────┐
          │  Zone   │ ← Follows right hand
          │ (Pink)  │   200x200px square
          └─────────┘
```

### Zone Properties
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels
- **Position**: Centered on palm (smoothed for stability)
- **Appearance**: Semi-transparent with glow effect
- **Colors**: Blue for left hand, Pink for right hand

## Gesture Detection

### Swipe Gesture
1. **Start**: Hand must be inside its own zone
2. **Move**: Swipe left or right (>15% screen width)
3. **Execute**: Navigate images
4. **Important**: Swipes starting outside zone are ignored

### Palm Gesture (Fullscreen)
1. **Show**: 5 fingers while hand is in its zone
2. **Execute**: Toggle fullscreen
3. **Release**: Lower fingers to reset

## 3-Action Buffer
After any gesture:
1. System enters waiting mode
2. Shows progress dots: ○○○
3. Counts next 3 hand actions
4. Returns to ready state: ●●●

## Visual Feedback

### Zone Indicators
- **Active Zone**: Glowing border when hand is inside
- **Zone Label**: Shows which hand owns the zone
- **Palm Glow**: Extra indicator when hand is in zone

### Debug Panel
Shows for each hand:
- Visibility status
- Position (% of screen)
- Finger count
- Zone active status

## Configuration

```javascript
const MIRROR_MODE = true;    // Handle camera mirroring
const ZONE_SIZE = 200;       // Zone size in pixels
const ZONE_OFFSET = 100;     // Offset from palm center

// Smoothing for zone movement
const smoothing = 0.3;       // 0 = no smoothing, 1 = no movement
```

## Why This Approach?

### Advantages
1. **Natural Movement**: Zones follow your hands anywhere
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Visual zones show active areas
3. **Prevents False Positives**: Gestures must start in zone
4. **Flexible Positioning**: Work from any comfortable position

### Use Cases
- **Presentations**: Move freely while controlling slides
- **Accessibility**: Adjust hand position for comfort
- **Standing/Sitting**: Zones adapt to your posture

## Implementation Details

### Zone Tracking
```javascript
// Each hand maintains:
zoneCenter: { x: 0, y: 0 }      // Smoothed position
gestureStartInZone: boolean      // Track gesture origin
history: []                      // Position history
```

### Gesture Requirements
- Swipes must start inside the hand's zone
- If hand leaves zone mid-swipe, gesture continues
- New swipes cannot start outside zones

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Hands Visible**: Zones appear only when hands are detected
2. **Start in Zone**: Begin gestures with hand inside its zone
3. **Natural Movement**: Zones follow smoothly, no need to chase them
4. **Watch the Glow**: Visual feedback shows when you're in zone

## Troubleshooting

### Zone Not Following Properly
- Check lighting conditions
- Ensure full hand is visible
- Move hand slowly for smooth tracking

### Gestures Not Detected
- Verify hand is inside zone (look for glow)
- Start gesture from within zone
- Check debug panel for zone active status

### Zones Jumping Around
- Improve lighting
- Reduce background movement
- Adjust smoothing parameter if needed

## When to Use Each System

### Use Fixed Zones When:
- Working at a desk with hands in consistent positions
- Want designated "home" areas for each hand
- Prefer predictable zone locations
- Multiple users need to know where zones are

### Use Dynamic Zones When:
- Moving around during presentations
- Need flexibility in hand positioning
- Accessibility requirements (adjust for comfort)
- Want zones to adapt to your posture
- Single user with varying positions
