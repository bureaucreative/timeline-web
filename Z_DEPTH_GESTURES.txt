# Z-DEPTH GESTURE DETECTION

## Overview
Enhanced gesture control system that uses Z-depth detection to distinguish between:
- **Palm facing camera** â†’ Fullscreen gestures
- **Hand in profile** â†’ Navigation/swipe gestures

## How It Works

### Z-Depth Detection Algorithm
The system analyzes multiple hand characteristics to determine orientation:

1. **Hand Aspect Ratio**
   - Palm facing: Wider (higher width/height ratio)
   - Profile: Narrower (lower width/height ratio)

2. **Knuckle Spacing**
   - Palm facing: Larger spacing between finger knuckles
   - Profile: Compressed knuckle spacing

3. **Thumb Position**
   - Palm facing: Thumb more separated from index finger
   - Profile: Thumb closer or overlapping with other fingers

### Gesture Modes

#### Palm Facing Mode (Green indicator)
- âœ‹ Show 5 fingers â†’ Enter fullscreen
- âœŠ Close hand â†’ Exit fullscreen
- Natural "stop" gesture for viewing

#### Side View Mode (Blue indicator)
- ðŸ‘‰ Swipe left â†’ Previous image
- ðŸ‘ˆ Swipe right â†’ Next image
- Natural sideways motion for navigation
#### Transition Mode (Orange indicator)
- System is detecting hand position change
- Wait for stable orientation

## Visual Feedback

1. **Depth Indicator Bar** (top right)
   - Shows real-time hand orientation
   - Color-coded: Green (palm), Blue (profile), Orange (transition)

2. **Hand Visualization**
   - Color changes based on detected orientation
   - Shows hand skeleton for debugging

3. **Status Messages**
   - Context-aware instructions based on current mode

## Technical Details

### Palm Score Calculation
```
palmScore = (aspectRatio Ã— 0.4) + (knuckleSpacing Ã— 0.4) + (thumbDistance Ã— 0.2)
```

### Thresholds
- Palm mode: Score > 60
- Profile mode: Score < 40
- Transition: Score 40-60

## Benefits
1. More natural gesture interaction
2. Prevents accidental mode switching
3. Clear visual feedback for user orientation
4. Intuitive gesture mapping (palm = stop/view, profile = navigate)

## Usage Tips
- Keep hand steady for reliable detection
- Face palm directly at camera for fullscreen
- Turn hand sideways for navigation
- Watch the depth indicator for feedback
