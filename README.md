## üè† NEW: Return to Home Position System!
Check out `return-to-home.html` for natural gesture flow:
- **Hands appear on correct sides** - right hand on right, left on left
- **Large 200px home circles** - easy to see and reach
- **Faster detection** - 8% threshold, 0.5s setup time
- **Home position** automatically set when hand appears
- **Gestures start from home** - swipe left/right to navigate
- **Must return to home** before next gesture (orange circle guides you)
- **üñêÔ∏è Palm zoom** - Show 5 fingers to zoom image to fit screen
- **‚úä Fist restore** - Close hand to return image to normal size
- **Visual states** - Green=ready, Orange=waiting, Red=gesture
- **Enhanced feedback** - arrows, "CLOSE!" indicator, distance bars
- **Natural rhythm** - like reaching out and pulling back
- **No time pressure** - return at your own pace
- **Perfect for presentations** - deliberate, clear control

## üéØ NEW: Dynamic Hand Zones!
Check out `dynamic-hand-zones.html` for zones that follow your hands:
- **200x200px zones** move with each hand
- **Zones appear/disappear** with hand detection
- **Gestures must start in zone** to prevent false positives
- **Visual feedback** with glowing borders and zone labels
- **Works anywhere** - no fixed positions required
- **Smooth tracking** with configurable smoothing
- **Perfect for presentations** or accessibility needs

## ü§≤ NEW: Two-Handed System with 3-Action Buffer!
Check out `two-handed-buffer.html` for natural two-handed interaction:
- **Hands rest on sides** - right hand controls right zone, left controls left
- **3-action buffer** prevents return movements from triggering gestures
- **Visual progress dots** (‚óã‚óã‚óã ‚Üí ‚óè‚óè‚óè) show buffer state
- **8 action types tracked** (movement, open/close, appear/disappear)
- **Independent hand tracking** for true two-handed control
- **No time-based waiting** - you control the pace with natural movements
- **Logical zone mapping** - right hand ‚Üí right zone (even though it appears left in mirror)

**Quick Test**: Open `hand-detection-test.html` to verify hand detection is working correctly!

## üéØ NEW: Swipe-First Priority Mode with Cooldown!
Check out `swipe-priority.html` for the best balance:
- **Swipe works at almost any hand angle** (< 70 score)
- **Fullscreen requires perfect palm** (85+ score)
- **Hold time prevents accidental fullscreen**
- **1.5 second cooldown after each gesture**
- **Visual countdown and progress bar during cooldown**
- **Clear feedback about requirements**

## üé¨ Smooth Sliding Animations!
Check out `swipe-animation-enhanced.html` for the best experience:
- Images slide smoothly in the direction of your swipe
- Swipe left ‚Üí image slides out left, new image slides in from right
- Swipe right ‚Üí image slides out right, new image slides in from left
- Natural gesture-to-visual mapping
- Preloaded images for instant response

## ‚ö° Enhanced Side-Handed Swipe Detection Available!
Check out `side-swipe-enhanced.html` for the best swipe experience:
- Multi-point hand tracking for stability
- Velocity-based swipe detection
- Visual trail showing hand movement
- Progress bars and real-time feedback
- Lower thresholds for easier swiping

## ‚ö° Enhanced Profile Detection Available!
For better profile hand detection, check out `profile-detection-enhanced.html` which includes:
- Multiple detection metrics (finger overlap, thumb visibility, hand compactness)
- Real-time visualization of all detection parameters
- More reliable profile/palm differentiation

## How to Use

### Testing Z-Depth Detection
1. Open `zdepth-test.html` in your browser
2. Allow camera access
3. Show your hand to the camera
4. Watch the metrics change as you rotate your hand:
   - Palm facing camera ‚Üí Green (high score)
   - Hand sideways ‚Üí Blue (low score)
   - In between ‚Üí Orange (transition)

### Using the Timeline Viewer
1. Open `gesture-zdepth.html` in your browser
2. Allow camera access
3. Use gestures based on hand orientation:

#### Palm Facing Mode (‚úã)
- **Show 5 fingers** ‚Üí Enter fullscreen
- **Close fist** ‚Üí Exit fullscreen
- Natural "stop" gesture for viewing

#### Side View Mode (üëâ)
- **Swipe left** ‚Üí Previous image
- **Swipe right** ‚Üí Next image
- Natural sideways motion for navigation

## Visual Indicators

- **Top Left**: Finger count and movement detection
- **Top Right**: Hand orientation with depth bar
- **Center**: Hand visualization (color-coded)
- **Bottom**: Context-aware instructions

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Good lighting** - Ensure your hand is well-lit
2. **Clear background** - Avoid busy backgrounds
3. **Steady movements** - Smooth, deliberate gestures work best
4. **Proper distance** - Keep hand 1-2 feet from camera
5. **Try different modes**:
   - **Return to Home** (`return-to-home.html`) - Most natural flow
   - **Dynamic zones** (`dynamic-hand-zones.html`) - Flexible positioning
   - **Fixed zones** (`two-handed-buffer.html`) - Stationary use
   - **State machine** (`gesture-state-machine.html`) - Neutral zone
   - **Simple cooldown** (`swipe-priority.html`) - Time-based

## Keyboard Shortcuts (for testing)
- **Arrow Left/Right** - Navigate images
- **F** - Toggle fullscreen
- **Click image** - Toggle fullscreen

## Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with WebRTC support
- Camera/webcam access
- JavaScript enabled

Enjoy the enhanced gesture control! üéâ
