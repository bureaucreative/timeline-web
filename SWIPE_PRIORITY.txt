# SWIPE-FIRST GESTURE PRIORITY

## Overview
The new `swipe-priority.html` file modifies the gesture detection to strongly prioritize swiping over fullscreen, making navigation the primary interaction mode.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Stricter Palm Detection (85+ score required)**
- Old: Palm mode activated at score > 60
- **New: Palm mode requires score > 85**
- Near-perfect palm facing required for fullscreen
- Shows palm score percentage when approaching threshold

### 2. **Easier Swipe Detection (< 70 score)**
- Old: Profile mode at score < 40
- **New: Swipe mode works at score < 70**
- Much wider range for swipe detection
- Covers most hand positions

### 3. **New Transition Zone (70-85)**
- Called "transition-swipe" mode
- **Swipes still work in this zone!**
- Purple color indicator
- Status: "Swipe works at any angle!"

### 4. **Hold Time for Fullscreen**
- Must hold perfect palm position for ~0.5 seconds
- Progress indicator shows hold percentage
- Prevents accidental fullscreen activation
- Requires deliberate gesture

### 5. **Lower Swipe Thresholds**
- Movement threshold: 0.12 (was 0.15)
- Velocity threshold: 0.25 (was 0.3)
- Start detection: 0.03 (was 0.05)
- Easier and more responsive swiping

## Visual Feedback

### Palm Confidence Display
- Shows when score > 70
- Displays: "Palm Score: XX% (Need 85%+ for fullscreen)"
- Helps users understand why fullscreen isn't activating

### Mode Indicators
- **Green**: Palm mode (85+ score)
- **Blue**: Profile mode (< 70 score)
- **Purple**: Transition-swipe mode (70-85)

### Status Messages
- Clear feedback about current mode
- Tells users exactly what score they need
- Shows hold progress for fullscreen

## Usage Experience

### For Swiping:
1. Works in almost any hand position
2. No need for perfect side view
3. Quick response to gestures
4. Works even in transition zone

### For Fullscreen:
1. Requires deliberate palm facing
2. Must achieve 85+ palm score
3. Hold 5 fingers for 0.5 seconds
4. Clear visual feedback during hold

## Benefits

1. **Swipe Navigation is Primary**
   - Works in 85% of hand positions
   - Lower thresholds for easier triggering
   - No accidental fullscreen interruptions

2. **Fullscreen is Deliberate**
   - Requires perfect positioning
   - Hold time prevents accidents
   - Clear requirements shown to user

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Natural prioritization of common action (swiping)
   - Fullscreen only when intentionally activated
   - Clear feedback about gesture requirements

## Technical Details

### Orientation Thresholds
```javascript
if (depthScore > 85) {
  return 'palm';           // Strict requirement
} else if (depthScore < 70) {
  return 'profile';        // Easy to achieve
} else {
  return 'transition-swipe'; // Swipe still works!
}
```

### Fullscreen Requirements
1. Palm score >= 85
2. 5 fingers extended
3. Hold for 15 frames (~0.5 seconds)
4. Visual progress indicator

This configuration makes the system much more practical for everyday use, with swipe navigation being the primary interaction and fullscreen being a special mode requiring deliberate activation.
