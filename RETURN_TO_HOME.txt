# RETURN TO HOME GESTURE SYSTEM

## Overview
A gesture recognition system that requires hands to return to their initial "home" position after each gesture. This creates a natural, deliberate gesture flow where each action has a clear beginning and end. The display is mirrored so your right hand appears on the right side of the screen.

## Features
1. **Swipe Navigation** - Move hand left/right from home position
2. **Return to Home** - Must return to home circle before next swipe
3. **Palm Zoom** - Show palm (5 fingers) to zoom image to fit screen
4. **Fist to Restore** - Close hand to return image to normal size

## Display Mirroring
- **Right hand** appears on the **right side** of screen
- **Left hand** appears on the **left side** of screen
- This matches your natural perspective (like looking at your hands, not in a mirror)

## How It Works

### 1. Home Position Setup
- When you first show your hand, it sets a "home position" after 0.5 seconds
- A 200px circle appears marking this home location
- Each hand has its own home position

### 2. Swipe Navigation
- Swipe left/right by moving hand away from home (>15% screen width)
- System detects gesture and navigates images
- Hand turns red during gesture

### 3. Return to Home
- After gesture, hand turns orange
- Home circle pulses orange
- Must return hand to home circle before next gesture
- Circle turns green when hand is home and ready

### 4. Palm Zoom Gestures (NEW!)
- **Zoom In**: Show open palm with 5 fingers
  - Palm score must be >65% (facing camera)
  - Hold for 0.5 seconds (see progress %)
  - Image expands to fit screen
- **Zoom Out**: Close hand (make fist)
  - 0-1 fingers detected
  - Image returns to 80% size instantly
- Works independently of swipe gestures
- Visual feedback shows palm detection

## Visual States

### Hand Colors
- **Blue/Pink** (normal) - Ready for gesture
- **Red** - Performing swipe gesture
- **Orange** - Waiting to return home
- **Green circle on palm** - Palm detected (zoom ready)

### Home Circle States
- **White dashed** - Default home position
- **Green glow** - Hand is home and ready
- **Orange pulse** - Waiting for return

### Status Display
```
READY              → Ready for gesture
GESTURE DETECTED   → Performing action
WAITING           → Return to home position
Hold palm...      → Palm gesture progress
```

### Zoom Indicator
- **🔍 ZOOMED** badge appears when image is zoomed
- Green border indicates active zoom state

## Configuration

```javascript
HOME_THRESHOLD = 0.08    // 8% of screen = "at home" (faster detection)
SWIPE_THRESHOLD = 0.15   // 15% movement triggers swipe
HOME_SET_DELAY = 500     // 0.5 seconds to set home (faster setup)
HOME_CIRCLE_SIZE = 200px // Large visual target (2x original)

// Palm gesture settings
PALM_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 65  // 65% palm score required
PALM_HOLD_THRESHOLD = 15   // ~0.5 seconds hold time
```

## Visual Improvements

### Larger Home Circle
- **200px diameter** (doubled from 100px)
- **Center dot** for precise targeting
- **Glow effect** when waiting or ready
- **Clear visual target** easy to see and reach

### Faster Detection
- **8% threshold** (up from 5%) = larger detection area
- **0.5s setup time** (down from 1s) = quicker to start
- **"CLOSE!" indicator** when approaching home
- **Arrow pointer** showing direction to home

### Enhanced Feedback
- **Distance bar** turns green when close to home
- **Pulsing orange** circle when waiting
- **Bright green** circle when ready
- **Line and arrow** guide you back to home

## State Machine

```
READY → GESTURE_ACTIVE → WAITING_FOR_HOME → READY
  ↑                                           ↓
  └───────────── Hand at home ────────────────┘
```

## Why This Approach?

### Natural Flow
1. **Start** - Hand at rest (home)
2. **Action** - Deliberate movement away
3. **Return** - Natural return to rest
4. **Ready** - Clear visual confirmation

### Benefits
- **Prevents accidental gestures** - Must start from home
- **Natural rhythm** - Matches how we naturally move
- **Clear feedback** - Always know system state
- **No time pressure** - Return at your own pace

## Usage Instructions

1. **Show hand** → Wait 0.5 seconds for home to set
2. **See white circle** → Your home position is marked
3. **Swipe from home** → Navigate images (>15% screen width)
4. **See orange circle** → Return hand there
5. **Watch for "CLOSE!"** → You're almost home
6. **See green circle** → Ready for next gesture

## Visual Indicators
- **Distance bar** in debug panel shows how far from home
- **Arrow pointer** guides you back when waiting
- **Glow effects** indicate current state
- **Center dot** shows exact home center

## Debug Information

The debug panel shows:
- Hand visibility
- Home position status
- Distance from home (with progress bar)
- Current state

## Comparison with Other Systems

### vs. 3-Action Buffer
- **This**: Wait for spatial return (position-based)
- **Buffer**: Wait for N actions (count-based)

### vs. Time Cooldown
- **This**: User controls timing by returning home
- **Cooldown**: Fixed waiting period

### vs. Dynamic Zones
- **This**: Fixed home positions
- **Zones**: Moving gesture areas

## Best Practices

1. **Set home comfortably** - Choose a natural resting position
2. **Make deliberate gestures** - Clear movements from home
3. **Return naturally** - No need to rush back
4. **Watch the colors** - Visual feedback guides you

## Troubleshooting

### Home Position Issues
- Keep hand steady for 0.5 seconds to set home
- If home is in wrong place, hide and show hand again
- Good lighting helps with stable detection

### Detection Too Slow?
The system now has:
- **8% detection threshold** (60% larger than original)
- **200px visual circles** (2x larger than original)
- **0.5s setup time** (2x faster than original)
- **"CLOSE!" indicator** when approaching home
- **Arrow guides** pointing back to home

### Gesture Not Detected
- Ensure you start from home position
- Move far enough (>15% screen width)
- Check that state is "READY" before swiping

### Can't Return Home
- Look for orange pulsing circle
- Move hand to center of circle
- Distance bar shows how close you are

## When to Use This System

### Good For:
- **Presentations** - Clear, deliberate control
- **Accessibility** - Predictable interaction pattern
- **Precision** - Prevents accidental inputs
- **Teaching** - Easy to understand flow

### Consider Alternatives For:
- Rapid navigation needs
- Continuous gestures
- Multi-hand simultaneous control
