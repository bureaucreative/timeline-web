# ENHANCED SIDE-HANDED SWIPE DETECTION

## Overview
The new `side-swipe-enhanced.html` file includes sophisticated side-handed swipe detection with visual feedback and improved accuracy.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Point Tracking**
- Uses 3 hand landmarks for stable tracking:
  - Wrist (landmark 0)
  - Middle finger MCP (landmark 9)
  - Index fingertip (landmark 8)
- Averages positions for smoother motion detection

### 2. **Velocity-Based Detection**
- Calculates swipe velocity in pixels per second
- Detects fast swipes even with smaller movements
- Shows real-time velocity indicator (top right)

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- **Swipe Trail**: Colored trail follows hand movement
  - Green trail for right swipes
  - Pink trail for left swipes
- **Progress Bar**: Shows swipe completion percentage
- **Velocity Meter**: Real-time speed indicator
- **Status Updates**: Shows swipe direction and confidence

### 4. **Enhanced Thresholds**
- Lower movement threshold (0.15 vs 0.2) for easier swipes
- Velocity threshold (0.3) for quick gestures
- Combined detection: triggers on distance OR velocity

### 5. **Swipe States**
```javascript
swipeState = {
  history: [],        // Position history
  velocity: 0,        // Current velocity
  direction: null,    // 'left' or 'right'
  progress: 0,        // 0-1 completion
  isActive: false,    // Currently swiping
  startTime: 0,       // Swipe start time
  trail: []          // Visual trail points
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Side View Detection**: First ensures hand is in profile/side view
2. **Motion Tracking**: Tracks multiple points over time
3. **Velocity Calculation**: Measures speed of movement
4. **Threshold Check**: Triggers on distance OR velocity
5. **Visual Feedback**: Shows trail, progress, and status
6. **Navigation**: Executes image navigation on successful swipe

## Visual Indicators

- **Debug Info**: Shows fingers, swipe direction, velocity, and mode
- **Trail Visualization**: Colored line following hand movement
- **Progress Indicator**: Bar showing swipe completion
- **Velocity Meter**: Speed indicator (only visible in side view)
- **Status Messages**: Real-time feedback on swipe state

## Usage Tips

1. **Turn hand sideways** - Ensure "Side View Facing" mode
2. **Swipe horizontally** - Move hand left or right
3. **Quick swipes work** - Fast movements trigger even with small distance
4. **Watch the trail** - Visual feedback shows your movement
5. **Check velocity meter** - Shows how fast you're moving

## Improvements Over Original

- ✅ More reliable detection in side view
- ✅ Visual feedback during swipe
- ✅ Velocity-based triggering
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Multi-point tracking for stability
- ✅ Lower thresholds for easier swipes
- ✅ Real-time debugging information

The enhanced system makes side-handed swipes much more natural and responsive!
