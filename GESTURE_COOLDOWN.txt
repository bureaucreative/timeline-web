# GESTURE COOLDOWN FEATURE

## Overview
The gesture system now includes a 1.5 second cooldown period after each successful swipe or fullscreen toggle. This prevents rapid successive gestures and provides a better user experience.

## How It Works

### Cooldown Triggers
- **After any swipe** (left or right)
- **After entering fullscreen** (5 fingers with palm)
- **After exiting fullscreen** (closed fist)

### Visual Feedback During Cooldown

1. **Countdown Timer**
   - Shows "Cooldown: 1.2s" on canvas
   - Updates in real-time

2. **Progress Bar**
   - Orange bar showing remaining cooldown time
   - Depletes from full to empty over 1.5 seconds

3. **Status Message**
   - "⏳ Wait 1.2s before next gesture"
   - Changes to "Ready for next gesture" when done

4. **Visual Dimming**
   - Images become slightly grayed out (60% opacity)
   - Subtle grayscale filter applied

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Accidental Gestures**
   - No rapid-fire navigation
   - Time to see each image properly

2. **Animation Completion**
   - Slide animations finish smoothly
   - No overlapping transitions

3. **Clear User Feedback**
   - Users know when they can gesture again
   - No confusion about why gestures aren't working

4. **Better Control**
   - More deliberate navigation
   - Reduced gesture errors

## Technical Implementation

### Key Variables
```javascript
let gestureCooldown = false;    // Cooldown active flag
let cooldownTimer = null;       // Timer reference
let cooldownEndTime = 0;        // When cooldown ends
```

### Cooldown Function
```javascript
function startGestureCooldown() {
  gestureCooldown = true;
  cooldownEndTime = Date.now() + 1500;
  imageSlider.classList.add('cooldown-active');
  
  cooldownTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    gestureCooldown = false;
    imageSlider.classList.remove('cooldown-active');
    status.textContent = 'Ready for next gesture';
  }, 1500);
}
```

### Early Return in updateCanvas
During cooldown, the system:
1. Shows cooldown visuals
2. Skips all gesture detection
3. Returns early from update loop

## User Experience

### Before Cooldown
- Could accidentally swipe multiple times
- Animations could overlap
- Confusing rapid changes

### After Cooldown
- One gesture at a time
- Clear visual feedback
- Smooth, controlled navigation
- Professional feel

The 1.5 second delay is long enough to see the result of your gesture but short enough to not feel sluggish.
