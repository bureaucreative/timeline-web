# GESTURE STATE MACHINE WITH NEUTRAL ZONE

## Overview
Advanced gesture recognition system that distinguishes between intentional gestures and natural hand return movements using a finite state machine (FSM) and neutral zone detection.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Neutral Zone**
- Center 40% of screen (adjustable)
- Acts as "home" position for hand
- Gestures must start by leaving this zone
- Hand must return here before next gesture

### 2. **State Machine**
```
IDLE → GESTURE_START → GESTURE_CONFIRMED → WAIT_FOR_RETURN → IDLE
```

#### States Explained:

**IDLE** (Green)
- Default state
- Hand is in neutral zone or no gesture active
- Waiting for gesture to begin

**GESTURE_START** (Orange)
- Hand has left neutral zone
- Tracking movement for potential gesture
- Checking velocity and distance thresholds

**GESTURE_CONFIRMED** (Red)
- Valid gesture detected
- Action executed (swipe/fullscreen)
- Brief transitional state

**WAIT_FOR_RETURN** (Blue)
- Gesture complete, ignoring movements
- Waiting for hand to return to neutral zone
- Prevents detecting return movement as new gesture

## Visual Feedback

### On-Screen Elements:
1. **Neutral Zone Box** - Dashed rectangle showing safe area
2. **State Indicator** - Current state with color coding
3. **Gesture Progress** - Shows how close to triggering (0-100%)
4. **Hand Trail** - Visual path during GESTURE_START
5. **Start Point** - Yellow dot where gesture began

### State Colors:
- Hand circle changes color based on current state
- Green → Orange → Red → Blue → Green cycle

## Gesture Requirements

### For Swipe Recognition:
1. Hand must leave neutral zone
2. Meet ONE of these criteria:
   - Distance > 0.15 (15% of screen width)
   - Velocity > 0.4 (fast movement)
3. Minimum gesture time: 100ms (filters accidental movements)
4. Maximum gesture time: 1000ms (timeout)

### For Fullscreen:
- Only works in IDLE or WAIT_FOR_RETURN states
- Requires palm score ≥ 85%
- Hold 5 fingers for 0.5 seconds
- Returns to WAIT_FOR_RETURN after toggle

## Benefits

### 1. **No False Positives**
- Return movements ignored in WAIT_FOR_RETURN state
- Hand must deliberately leave neutral zone to start gesture

### 2. **Clear Intent**
- Gestures require deliberate movement from center
- Natural hand positions don't trigger actions

### 3. **Visual Clarity**
- Always know current state
- See exactly where neutral zone is
- Progress indicators show gesture detection

### 4. **Timeout Protection**
- If hand doesn't return within 2 seconds, auto-reset to IDLE
- Prevents getting stuck in WAIT_FOR_RETURN

## Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters:
```javascript
// Neutral Zone (0-1 normalized coordinates)
NEUTRAL_ZONE = {
  xMin: 0.3,  // 30% from left
  xMax: 0.7,  // 70% from left
  yMin: 0.3,  // 30% from top
  yMax: 0.7   // 70% from top
}

// Gesture Thresholds
GESTURE_THRESHOLDS = {
  minDistance: 0.15,        // Movement required
  minVelocity: 0.4,         // Speed alternative
  maxReturnTime: 2000,      // Return timeout (ms)
  gestureTimeout: 1000,     // Gesture timeout (ms)
  minGestureTime: 100       // Minimum time (ms)
}
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Start**: Hand in neutral zone (IDLE)
2. **Initiate**: Move hand outside zone
3. **Execute**: Swipe left/right with intent
4. **Wait**: System enters WAIT_FOR_RETURN
5. **Return**: Bring hand back to center
6. **Ready**: System returns to IDLE

## Debugging

The state indicator shows:
- Current state name and color
- Whether hand is in neutral zone
- Gesture progress percentage
- Real-time state transitions

## Best Practices

1. **Start from Center** - Always begin gestures from neutral zone
2. **Deliberate Movements** - Make intentional, clear gestures
3. **Return to Center** - Complete the cycle for clean detection
4. **Watch State Indicator** - Understand current system state

This approach creates a robust gesture system that feels natural and prevents accidental activations!
