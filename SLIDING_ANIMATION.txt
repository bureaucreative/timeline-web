# SWIPE WITH IMAGE SLIDING ANIMATION

## Overview
The new `swipe-animation-enhanced.html` file includes smooth sliding animations that match your swipe gestures, creating a more natural and intuitive navigation experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Directional Sliding Animation**
- **Swipe Left** → Current image slides out to the left, new image slides in from the right
- **Swipe Right** → Current image slides out to the right, new image slides in from the left
- Creates natural continuity between gesture and visual feedback

### 2. **Three-Image Preloading System**
```javascript
// Always keeps 3 images ready:
- Previous image (hidden on the left)
- Current image (visible in center)
- Next image (hidden on the right)
```

### 3. **Smooth CSS Transitions**
- Uses `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for natural motion
- 600ms animation duration
- Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth performance

### 4. **Animation States**
```css
.image-wrapper.current {
  transform: translateX(0);        /* Centered */
}
.image-wrapper.prev {
  transform: translateX(-100%);    /* Off-screen left */
}
.image-wrapper.next {
  transform: translateX(100%);     /* Off-screen right */
}
.image-wrapper.slide-out-left {
  transform: translateX(-100%);    /* Sliding out left */
}
.image-wrapper.slide-out-right {
  transform: translateX(100%);     /* Sliding out right */
}
```

## How It Works

### Swipe Right (Next Image):
1. Current image slides out to the left
2. Next image slides in from the right
3. Previous image is updated for next swipe

### Swipe Left (Previous Image):
1. Current image slides out to the right
2. Previous image slides in from the left
3. Next image is updated for next swipe

## Visual Flow Example

```
Initial State:
[PREV]  [CURRENT]  [NEXT]
 (hidden)  (visible)  (hidden)

Swipe Right →
[PREV]←[CURRENT]←[NEXT]
         slides     slides
         left       to center

After Animation:
[NEW PREV] [NEW CURRENT] [NEW NEXT]
(old current) (old next)   (preloaded)
```

## Benefits

1. **Natural Gesture Mapping** - Swipe direction matches image movement
2. **Smooth Transitions** - No jarring image changes
3. **Performance** - Preloaded images ensure instant response
4. **Visual Continuity** - User can follow the image movement
5. **Professional Feel** - Modern app-like navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions:
- `slideImages(direction)` - Orchestrates the sliding animation
- `preloadImages()` - Ensures adjacent images are ready
- `updateDisplay()` - Updates the current image and info

### Animation Safety:
- `isAnimating` flag prevents overlapping animations
- `canNavigate` cooldown prevents rapid-fire navigation
- Proper cleanup after each animation

## Usage

1. Turn hand to side view
2. Swipe left or right
3. Watch images slide smoothly in the swipe direction
4. Navigation arrows still appear for feedback
5. Keyboard arrows also trigger sliding animations

The sliding animation creates a much more polished and intuitive experience compared to instant image changes!
