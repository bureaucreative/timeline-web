# ENHANCED PROFILE DETECTION UPDATE

## What Changed
I've created an improved profile detection algorithm that better recognizes when your hand is turned sideways. The enhanced version is available in: `profile-detection-enhanced.html`

## New Detection Metrics

### 1. **Finger Overlap Detection** (30% weight)
- Detects when fingers appear close together (common in profile view)
- Scores higher when fingertips have X-coordinate differences < 0.03

### 2. **Thumb Visibility** (20% weight)
- Checks if thumb is hidden behind the hand
- Profile hands often have the thumb overlapping with other fingers

### 3. **Hand Compactness** (20% weight)
- Measures the spread from index to pinky finger
- Profile hands appear more compact/narrow

### 4. **Knuckle Spacing** (20% weight)
- Profile hands have tighter knuckle spacing
- Inverted scoring (smaller spacing = more profile-like)

### 5. **Aspect Ratio** (10% weight)
- Profile hands are taller than wide (aspect ratio < 0.8)

## Improved Thresholds
- **Palm Mode**: Score > 55 (was 60)
- **Profile Mode**: Score < 45 (was 40)
- **Transition**: Score 45-55

## Testing the Enhancement
1. Open `profile-detection-enhanced.html`
2. Watch the detailed metrics as you rotate your hand
3. Notice how multiple indicators work together for better detection

## Benefits
- More reliable profile detection
- Less false positives
- Smoother transitions
- Better swipe gesture recognition

## Quick Fix for Original Files
To apply the enhanced detection to the original gesture-zdepth.html, you would need to replace the detectHandOrientation function with the enhanced version from profile-detection-enhanced.html.
